# ecvrf-rs
This crate contains functions for creating and verifying VRF proofs, following the [IETF VRF specification](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-vrf-12.html). Although this crate attempts to stick to the specification as closely as possible, not all functions are fully compliant with the specification. In addition, this crate only supports elliptic curve VRF functions, hence the name.

Javascript bindings for this crate are also available, in the [ecvrf-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@entropic-labs/ecvrf-js) package
